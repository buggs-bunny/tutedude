# Python Tasks Repository

This repository contains Python scripts for basic programming tasks. It includes solutions for Task 1 (basic mathematical operations) and Task 2 (personalized greeting). Both scripts are simple console-based programs.

## Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2. Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
3. Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

### Solution
- File: `op.py`
- The script prompts for two float numbers, computes the operations, and prints the results. It does not include a check to avoid division by zero.

### How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Open a terminal in the repository folder.
3. Run: `python task1.py`
4. Enter the numbers when prompted.

Example Output:
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0
```

## Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2. Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3. Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.

### Solution
- File: `task2.py`
- The script prompts for first and last names, combines them, and prints a greeting like "Hello, Full Name! Welcome to Python program".

### How to Run
1. Run: `python task2.py`
2. Enter names when prompted.

Example Output:
```
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe Welcome to Python program!
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries needed.
